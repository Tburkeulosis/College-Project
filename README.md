MQ-Sensor network
Hey everyone this is my first attempt at writing a code, I heavily used a code from this website but I am trying to get it to work with multiple MQ sensors to create raw data for a project.  As this is my first time writing code ever I am a bit lost so any help as to how to make this connect to, read and produce the sensor data in ppm would be a great help.  Thank you very much.
Also this is my first time using GitHub as well as programming so any and all help with both the code and the website is appreciated.
